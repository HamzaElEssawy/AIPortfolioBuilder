# Content Management System Fix

## Issues Identified
1. Text editor cursor jumping to beginning/end
2. Content not saving to live website
3. Many sections are static and not editable
4. Cache invalidation not working properly

## Root Causes
1. SimpleTextEditor using textContent instead of innerHTML
2. Content update endpoints not properly clearing cache
3. Missing connections between admin interface and live content
4. Cache system interfering with real-time updates

## Solution Plan
1. Fix text editor to properly handle rich text
2. Implement proper cache invalidation
3. Connect all sections to admin interface
4. Add comprehensive testing

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for text editor functionality
- Integration tests for content updates
- End-to-end tests for admin-to-live updates
