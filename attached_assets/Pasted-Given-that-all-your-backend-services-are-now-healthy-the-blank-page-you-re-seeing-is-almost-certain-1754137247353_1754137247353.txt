Given that all your backend services are now healthy, the blank‐page you’re seeing is almost certainly a **client-side rendering** issue. I’d recommend we **investigate the React app** directly (Option 1 below) before trying any other fancy workaround. Here’s a quick two-pronged plan:

---

## Option 1 – Debug the React app in isolation

1. **Run only the client**

   ```bash
   pnpm --filter @workspace/client dev
   ```

   — this drops the complexity of the monorepo and gives you a pure Vite/React console.

2. **Open the browser console**

   * Are there **JavaScript errors**? (missing imports, hooks mis-use, runtime exceptions)
   * Is the **network tab** returning a valid `index.html`? Any 404s for your bundle files?

3. **Smoke-test the entry point**

   * Edit `apps/client/src/main.tsx` to log something:

     ```ts
     console.log("🚀 React bootstrapped!");
     ```
   * Reload—do you see the message? If not, the file isn’t even loading.

4. **Verify your root `<div id="root">`**

   * In `public/index.html`, ensure your `<div id="root"></div>` matches the selector in `main.tsx`.

5. **Check your routes**

   * If you use client-side routing (Wouter/React-Router), try replacing `<App>` in `main.tsx` with a minimal component:

     ```tsx
     import React from "react";
     import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
     ReactDOM.render(<h1>Test!</h1>, document.getElementById("root"));
     ```
   * If “Test!” appears, the problem is inside your `<App>` or its children.

6. **Re-inject your real `<App>` piece by piece**

   * Bring back one component at a time (e.g. just `<Navigation/>`, then `<Home/>`, etc.) until it breaks.

Once you’ve captured any console errors or identified the offending component, we’ll have a precise fix.

## Option 2 – Temporary static‐build serve

If you’d rather **just see something on screen** while you debug:

1. **Build the client**

   ```bash
   pnpm --filter @workspace/client build
   ```
2. **Serve the `dist/` folder** from your API-gateway (or a simple `serve` package)

   ```ts
   app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, "../client/dist")));
   app.get("/*", (_, res) => res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, "../client/dist/index.html")));
   ```
3. Hit port 5000—you’ll at least see the production build.

This gets you “unblocked” visually, but you’ll still want to head back to Option 1 to root-cause the blank page.

### What I recommend

Let’s go with **Option 1**—run the React app standalone and capture the first console error or missing-file 404. Copy-paste that message here and I’ll guide you immediately to the offending import or component.
