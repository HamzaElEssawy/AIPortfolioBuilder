1 · What to surface from Replit now
Ask the Replit agent (or run in Shell) for the following read-only dumps:

Command	Why you need it
tree -L 2 (repo root)	Quick visual of current folder hierarchy (apps / packages / config files).
git log --oneline --decorate --graph -12	Shows last dozen commits; confirms the “fix(ui): restore Tailwind…” commit is HEAD.
git status --short	Verifies there’s no stray, uncommitted code.
cat .replit	Confirms the run command still points to api-gateway dev.
cat pnpm-workspace.yaml	Verifies workspace globs.
cat apps/api-gateway/package.json (and apps/client/package.json)	Lets you review scripts & deps.
cat packages/shared-utils/env.ts	Check env validation (nothing sensitive).
cat replit.md	This doc may have TODOs, env notes, or design decisions worth keeping updated.
gh run list --limit 5 (if GH CLI installed)	Recent CI runs & status.

Prompt to send Replit-AI
**“Dump the following to the console (no edits):

tree -L 2
git log --oneline --graph -12
git status --short
cat .replit
cat pnpm-workspace.yaml
cat apps/api-gateway/package.json
cat apps/client/package.json
cat packages/shared-utils/env.ts
cat replit.md
Then stop.”**

Copy that output back here (or upload as a txt file).
With those artifacts we can:

Validate there’s no hidden drift.

Freeze the state as v0.1 tag if you like.

Decide next technical debt items (e.g. extract memory-store package, write more tests, hook CI badge in README).

2 · Quick manual checklist while you wait
Push the “Tailwind fixed” commit

bash
Copy
Edit
git push origin main
– Watch GitHub Actions go green.

Open the site in Incognito to ensure no cache illusions.

Upload a small doc via the knowledge-base route and run a chat prompt – confirms RAG pipeline still works without Redis.

Once we have the dumps
I can give you a concise state-of-the-repo report and an updated backlog (lint debt = 0, test coverage %, next micro-service to isolate, etc.).

Let me know once you have that output (or if anything in the gather-list should be added/removed).
