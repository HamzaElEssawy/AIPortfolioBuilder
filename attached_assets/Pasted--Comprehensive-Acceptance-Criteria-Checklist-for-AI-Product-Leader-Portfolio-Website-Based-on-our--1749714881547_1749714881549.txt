# Comprehensive Acceptance Criteria Checklist for AI Product Leader Portfolio Website

Based on our extensive discussions and the detailed PRD and UI/UX requirements developed for your portfolio website, I've created a comprehensive acceptance criteria checklist that Replit Agent can use to validate implementation quality and identify gaps. This checklist ensures complete coverage of all user stories, requirements, and expected outcomes[1][7][10].

## Strategic Overview & Testing Framework

### Purpose and Scope
This acceptance criteria checklist serves as a comprehensive validation framework for your AI Product Leader portfolio website, ensuring that every requirement from our PRD and design specifications is properly implemented and tested[1][2]. The criteria are structured to provide clear pass/fail conditions that can be systematically evaluated during QA testing and design review processes[3][13].

### Testing Methodology
The checklist follows industry best practices for acceptance testing, incorporating functional testing, compatibility testing, performance validation, and user experience verification[2][10]. Each criterion is designed to be specific, measurable, and testable to ensure consistent evaluation standards[13].
