# Detailed Functional & UI/UX Requirements for AI-Powered Portfolio Admin Dashboard

Based on your preferences for simplicity with Claude integration and Google Drive integration for meeting transcripts, I've developed comprehensive functional and UI/UX requirements that can be directly implemented by AI agents like Replit or Bolt.

## 1. System Architecture Overview

### Core Technology Stack
The admin dashboard will utilize a modern headless CMS architecture with Claude API as the primary AI integration [1]. The system consists of a React-based frontend admin interface, Node.js backend API, PostgreSQL database for structured data, and Google Drive API integration for document management [5].

The architecture prioritizes simplicity while maintaining enterprise-grade functionality, allowing you to manage your portfolio website content and leverage AI-powered career guidance through a unified interface [8].

## 2. Authentication & Security System

### Login Flow & Security Requirements

**Authentication Implementation**
- JWT-based authentication with role-based access control [21]
- Two-factor authentication (2FA) for enhanced security [6]
- Session management with automatic timeout after 30 minutes of inactivity
- Password requirements: minimum 12 characters with special characters and numbers

**Login Page UI/UX Specifications**
```html
<div class="login-container">
  <div class="login-card">
    <h1>Portfolio Admin Dashboard</h1>
    <form class="login-form">
      <input type="email" placeholder="Email Address" required>
      <input type="password" placeholder="Password" required>
      <button type="submit">Sign In</button>
      <a href="/forgot-password">Forgot Password?</a>
    </form>
  </div>
</div>
```

**Security Best Practices Implementation**
- IP whitelisting for admin access [6]
- Rate limiting: maximum 5 login attempts per IP address per hour
- HTTPS enforcement with SSL certificate validation
- Hidden admin URL path (e.g., `/portfolio-admin-secure`) instead of common `/admin` [6]

### User Access Control
- Single admin user role with full system access
- Session logging and activity monitoring
- Automatic logout on browser close or extended inactivity

## 3. Dashboard Layout & Navigation

### Main Dashboard Interface

**Header Component**
```css
.dashboard-header {
  height: 64px;
  background: #1a365d;
  color: white;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
  padding: 0 24px;
}
```

**Sidebar Navigation**
- Portfolio Management (Case Studies, About, Experience)
- Media Library (Images, Documents, Resume Versions)
- AI Career Assistant
- Analytics & Performance
- Settings & Account

**Responsive Design Requirements**
- Mobile-first approach with collapsible sidebar for tablets and mobile [8]

- Quick actions (Add new case study, Upload resume, Start AI chat)
- System status indicators (API connections, backup status)

## 4. Portfolio Content Management System

### Case Study Management Interface

**Case Study Editor UI**
```html
<div class="case-study-editor">
  <div class="editor-header">
    <input type="text" placeholder="Case Study Title" class="title-input">
    <select class="status-dropdown">
      <option>Draft</option>
      <option>Published</option>
    </select>
  </div>
  
  <div class="content-sections">
    <section class="challenge-section">
      <h3>Challenge</h3>
      <textarea placeholder="Describe the business problem..."></textarea>
    </section>
    
    <section class="approach-section">
      <h3>Strategic Approach</h3>

## 5. AI Career Assistant Implementation

### Claude API Integration Architecture

**API Configuration**
```javascript
const anthropic = new Anthropic({
  apiKey: process.env.CLAUDE_API_KEY,
  baseURL: 'https://api.anthropic.com/v1'
});

const chatCompletion = await anthropic.messages.create({
  model: 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022',
  max_tokens: 4000,
  messages: conversations,
  system: knowledgeBaseContext
});
```

**Knowledge Base Integration**
The AI assistant utilizes a hybrid knowledge base approach combining your database-stored career information with document embeddings from Google Drive [12]. The system creates vector embeddings of your resume versions, interview transcripts, and achievement data to provide contextually relevant career guidance [1].

### Chatbot UI Design & Interaction Flow

  <div class="chat-messages" id="chatMessages">
    <!-- Messages populated dynamically -->
  </div>
  
  <div class="chat-input-area">
    <textarea placeholder="Ask about job applications, resume optimization, or career strategy..." 
              class="message-input" rows="3"></textarea>
    <button class="send-button">Send</button>
  </div>
  
  <div class="quick-actions">
    <button class="quick-action">Optimize Resume for Job</button>
    <button class="quick-action">Analyze Interview Performance</button>
