# Detailed Design Requirements for AI-Powered Portfolio Website Development

Perfect! Now that we have a solid PRD foundation, let's create comprehensive design requirements that will enable Google Stitch or UXPilot to generate outstanding designs for your AI Product Leader portfolio website. Based on my research, both tools require specific, structured prompts to produce professional results[1][2][3].

## Platform Comparison & Recommendation

### Google Stitch Analysis

Google Stitch is Google's newest AI design tool powered by Gemini 2.5 Pro that transforms text prompts and reference images into functional UI designs and frontend code within minutes[1][2]. The platform excels at generating complex UI designs with built-in export capabilities to Figma and HTML/CSS code generation[3][6]. Stitch supports theme customization, multiple design variants, and iterative refinement through conversational prompts[1][14].

### UXPilot Analysis

UXPilot is an AI-powered design platform that specializes in creating wireframes, high-fidelity screens, and complete user flows[4][7]. It offers both web-based and Figma plugin versions, making it ideal for rapid prototyping and design system integration[7]. UXPilot excels at generating multiple screen flows and maintaining design consistency across complex applications[4][7].

### Recommendation: Google Stitch

For your AI Product Leader portfolio, I recommend **Google Stitch** as the primary tool because it offers superior code generation capabilities that align with your plan to develop on Replit[1][6]. Stitch's ability to export production-ready HTML/CSS code will seamlessly integrate with your development workflow, while its Figma export option provides flexibility for design refinements[3][6].
