# Comprehensive System Audit Report

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Database Schema Misalignment
**CRITICAL**: The database schema is missing essential tables that the admin dashboard attempts to manage:

#### Missing Tables:
- `case_studies` - Referenced in admin dashboard but doesn't exist
- `media_assets` - Referenced in portfolio manager but doesn't exist
- `content_versions` - Referenced in content manager but doesn't exist
- `knowledge_base_documents` - Referenced in knowledge manager but doesn't exist

#### Current Database Schema:
```sql
-- Only these tables exist:
contact_submissions (id, name, email, project_type, message, submitted_at, company)
users (id, username, password)
```

### 2. Admin Dashboard Functions Analysis

#### Working Functions:
✅ Admin login/authentication
✅ Contact submissions display
✅ Content management (file-based, not database)

#### Broken Functions:
❌ Case study management - no database table
❌ Media asset management - no database table  
❌ Knowledge base management - no database table
❌ Portfolio analytics - missing data sources
❌ Content versioning - no database table

### 3. Data Flow Issues

#### Content Management:
- Admin dashboard uses file-based content storage (`server/contentManager.ts`)
- Portfolio sections read from JSON files in `data/` directory
- No database persistence for content changes
- Version control system references non-existent database tables

#### Portfolio-Dashboard Sync:
- Hero section: ✅ Working (file-based)
- About section: ✅ Working (file-based)
- Experience: ✅ Working (file-based)
- Case studies: ❌ Broken (missing database)
- Skills: ✅ Working (file-based)
- Contact: ✅ Working (database-backed)

## Immediate Actions Required

1. Create missing database tables with proper schema
2. Migrate file-based content to database
3. Fix all admin dashboard CRUD operations
4. Create comprehensive unit tests
5. Document the complete system architecture

## Next Steps

Creating the missing database schema and fixing all admin functions...
